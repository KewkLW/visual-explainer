## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-16

Initial release.

### Skill
- Core workflow: Think (pick aesthetic) → Structure (read template) → Style (apply design) → Deliver (write + open)
- 11 diagram types with rendering approach routing (Mermaid, CSS Grid, HTML tables, Chart.js)
- 9 aesthetic directions (monochrome terminal, editorial, blueprint, neon, paper/ink, sketch, IDE-inspired, data-dense, gradient mesh)
- Mermaid deep theming with `theme: 'base'` + `themeVariables`, hand-drawn mode, ELK layout
- Zoom controls (buttons, scroll-to-zoom, drag-to-pan) required on all Mermaid containers
- Proactive table rendering — agent generates HTML instead of ASCII for complex tables
- Optional AI-generated illustrations via surf-cli + Gemini Nano Banana Pro
- Both light and dark themes via CSS custom properties and `prefers-color-scheme`
- Quality checks: squint test, swap test, overflow protection, zoom controls verification
